        I am a chatbot that is capable of the following features:\\n
        1) General conversation (ask me anything and I will try my best to answer them! no guarantee what I answer will make sense though)\\n
        2) Generate text (just ask me to generate text, give a few words or a sentence for me to start from and I will give you a paragraph!)\\n
        3) Record feedback (tell me if you have any complains, feedback or feature suggestion to give)
